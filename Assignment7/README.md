Assignment 7 --
For STEP 1 -- Group of 5 parsed data - installed Cheerio, we tested Michael W's code, Run Node
For STEP 2 -- Created Post GresSql(RDS) Database -- used TAMU Key

We ran into many problems --- now in hindsight -- we needed to run our own code from Assignment 2 when we parsed our own Zones.  We didn't know how to 'clean' up our data at this point -- we were able to get the JSON files, but was an issue when we got to Assignment 6

12/2/18 -- Had to redo this for the final assignment -- The JSON files needed much more cleaning and parsing to get the correct data.  Now knowing this -- its important to understand how you want the end product to be and result in, and thoroughly clean, and parse the data so that its easily usable!
