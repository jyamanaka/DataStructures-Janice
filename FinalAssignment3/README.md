NOTES ON FINAL PROJECT - SENSOR READING

	RELIABILITY --
		My sensor was not reliable.  Also, my modem went out unknowingly periodically during the Thanksgiving holidays -- 
	There is a whole days of data reads are missing.  Cat knocked the sensor off the table - and the placement/readout had been upside down on the floor for a day.  

	SCALABILITY --
		The sensor read every 5 minutes.  However since I intiated it TWICE -- it read once at 1 minute and once at 4 minutes.  There was way too many readings of values. However my database was able to handle the reads, so it was fine.  There were alot of issues that came into play -- and it was definitely interesting to troubleshoot. 

	MAINTAINABILITY --
		Maintaining this sensor would be using alot of data and space that is unneccessary.  The values weren not that  as interesting as I had originally thought.  

	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS --
		The project was exciting.  The way that the Photon interacted with the photoresister, which then interacted with the database, which then interacted with how I queried the data -- was amazing -- and I enjoyed it, as many problems and headaches that arose

	MY INSPIRATION --
		COLOR PANEL V 1.0 - BY JOHN F. SIMON @ THE WHITNEY MUSEUM
		Color Panel v1.0 is a piece of software art displayed on components of a laptop computer modified by the artist, John F. Simon Jr. The software “controls the screen, draws the composition, picks the colors, [and] moves the colors,” producing constantly evolving compositions of squares and rectangles that deliberately evoke early modernist geometric abstraction. Simon cites the influence of Josef Albers and Johannes Itten, who investigated the apparent changes in hue caused by placing different colors next to one another. Simon addresses the same principles through software that explores color mixing in motion and over time. In each section of the screen, the software chooses from groups of possible color combinations without specifying the exact color to be picked. The color composition is therefore variable and open to chance; its sequences never repeat, progressing over a time frame that approaches eternity.
