THOUGHTS ON FINAL PROJECT - AA MEETINGS

RELIABILITY --
	A BIG lesson in the reliability of my AA meeting data is:
	-that I now know and understand that my data should be reliable -- however it was NOT proofread 
	-there is no FLEXIBILITY to how to query the information -- I only learned, and understood how to query by time.  I UNDERSTAND that there are many different ways to query about the AA meeting information -- one of which I KNOW would be important -- is to be ADA aware -- or handicapped accessibility for example.  

SCALABILITY --
	- 'types' of scalability -- but when and how much more data would need to be aggregated would be more interesting 
	-basic ideas of scalability was something that I learned during the course and didn't think about while working on this project.  The problem solving issues continue to be a question that remains constant.  
	-Always think about the problems that can arise -- and the fluctuating issues that come up with the data as it needs to grow.

MAINTAINABILITY --
	- hand in hand with SCALABILITY 
	- how long, how much data will be being aggregated.  
	- Are there other ways to maintain the data.  
	- What if this data grows or I want to go back to it?

	

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS --
		If I had known that the AA meeting data was pretty much ALL about PARSING -- and ACCURACY.  I would have been alot more aware of understanding how the scraping of the AA info would be so crucial.  It was a good problem to come to grips with during the semester learning first hand that you should anticipate wanting MORE DATA rather than less.
