NOTES ON FINAL PROJECT - DEAR DIARY

	RELIABILITY --
		The reliability was a human problem -- the Tarot card reading was only as good as my imput everyday. And I was not able to query by more than 1 element (date) -- which was frustrating.  

	SCALABILITY --
		This was an easily scalable database.  It was imput that needed to be written everyday, in the same format.  If I was forward thinking, I would have recreated this into a nosql database.  So it would have been easier to pull up different aspects of my TC readings 

	MAINTAINABILITY --
		This was an easy database to maintain as long as I kept the same format.  Again, the reliability was the biggest issue.  

	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS --
		This was an interesting project as it was very inflexible -- and frustrating.  In the end, I wished that I would have been able to have different types of access to my readings.
